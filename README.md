Aughma Dataflow Service
=======================

Aughma Dataflow Service aims to provide an ability to build data processing pipelines with reusable processing nodes. The processing pipelines are envisaged to be used with real time as well as batch data sources. The execution can be on the cloud or in-house hardware/software stack.

We are currently building the wiki, which will contain information about the concept, how to use it, and how to build custom processing nodes if need be.

We shall host it as a service at www.aughma.com.
