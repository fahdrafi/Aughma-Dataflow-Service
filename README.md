#Aughma Dataflow

With Aughma Dataflow Service, you can build your own data processing pipelines to analyse batch or streaming data utilizing a library of reusable processing nodes. We are currently developing it to work as a service on the google cloud platform, however we are designing it to be implementable for any other cloud provider or your own in-house frameworks using the java technology stack.

We are currently building the wiki, which will contain information about the concept, how to use it, and how to build custom processing nodes if need be.

We shall host it as a service at www.aughma.com.
